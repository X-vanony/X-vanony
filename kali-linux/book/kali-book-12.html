		<h1>LINUX BASICS FOR HACKERS</h1>
		<p>Chapter 1 will get you used to the file system and the terminal, and give you some basic commands</p>
		<p>Chapter 2 shows you how to manipulate text to find, examine, and alter software and files</p>
		<p>Chapter 3 you’ll manage networks. You’ll scan for networks, find information on connections, and disguise yourself by masking your network and DNS information</p>
		<p>Chapter 4 teaches you to add, remove, and update software, and how to keep your system streamlined</p>
		<p>Chapter 5, you’ll manipulate file and directory permissions to control who can access what. You’ll also learn some privilege escalation techniques</p>
		<p>Chapter 6 teaches you how to manage services, including starting and stopping processes and allocating resources to give you greater control</p>
		<p>Chapter 7 you’ll manage environment variables for optimal performance, convenience, and even stealth. You’ll find and filter variables, change your PATH variable, and create new environment variables</p>
		<p>Chapter 8 introduces you to bash scripting, a staple for any serious hacker. You’ll learn the basics of bash and build a script to scan for target ports that you might later infiltrate</p>
		<p>Chapters 9 and 10 give you some essential file system management skills, showing you how to compress and archive files to keep your system clean, copy entire storage devices, and get information on files and connected disks</p>
		<p>Chapter 11 you’ll use and manipulate the logging system to get information on a target’s activity and cover your own tracks</p>
		<p>Chapter 12 shows you how to use and abuse three core Linux services: Apache web server, OpenSSH, and MySQL. You’ll create a web server, build a remote video spy, and learn about databases and their vulnerabilities</p>
		<p>Chapter 13 will show you how to stay secure and anonymous with proxy servers, the Tor network, VPNs, and encrypted email.</p>
		<p>Chapter 14 deals with wireless networks. You’ll learn basic networking commands,then crack WiFi access points and detect and connect to Bluetooth signals</p>
		<p>Chapter 15 dives deeper into Linux itself with a high level view of how the kernel works and how its drivers can be abused to deliver malicious software</p>
		<p>Chapter 16 you’ll learn essential scheduling skills in order to automate your hacking scripts</p>
		<p>Chapter 17 will teach you core Python concepts, and you’ll script two hacking tools: a scanner to spy on TCP/IP connections, and a simple password cracker</p>
